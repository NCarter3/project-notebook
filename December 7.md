# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

## Post-critique summary and reflection

As a result of this critique and discussions last Wednesday, we decided that it would be best to combine
teams and work on this project together. So, Michael, Christine, and I are now one team. This critique 
also made us reevaluate what would work well for the language base. After further reflection, we decided not 
to use Todo.txt as a base and instead to start from scratch.

We are also looking at elucidating what an IR will look like for this language. There are definitely complexities
here that we did not fully understand when proposing the language. We are working on how to address these.
