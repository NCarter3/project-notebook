# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

<!-- **TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process. -->

I started by thinking more about what my project should be. This took, 
before Wednesday's class, a solid amount of time. The idea that I had
then was to extend an already existing DSL called `todo.txt`. This
DSL handles quite well todo list computations related to type and priority.
However, it does nothing about calendar or project computations. In class
on Wednesday, I realized that it
was a good idea to focus my idea on these topics, and to avoid conflicting
with another team that I should focus directly on calendar and repeating 
events. Some calculations about when events should happen and when they 
should be done would also be interesting. 

The rest of my time was spent on this documentation.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to decide on exactly what functionality to implement. And, in conjunction
with that, I need to think about what the DSL should look like -- should it be
an extension of an existing DSL or something new?

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What do you all think of my project idea? Any ideas or comments?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I don't have any idea... 4-6?
